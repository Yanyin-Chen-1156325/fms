## Database questions
1. What SQL statement creates the mobs table and defines its fields/columns? (Copy
and paste the relevant lines of SQL.)
2. Which lines of SQL script sets up the relationship between the mobs and paddocks
tables?
3. The current FMS only works for one farm. Write SQL script to create a new table
called farms, which includes a unique farm ID, the farm name, an optional short
description and the owner’s name. The ID can be added automatically by the
database. (Relationships to other tables not required.)
4. Write an SQL statement to add details for an example farm to your new farms table,
which would be suitable to include in your web application for the users to add farms
in a future version. (Type in actual values, don’t use %s markers.)
5.What changes would you need to make to other tables to incorporate the new farms
table? (Describe the changes. SQL script not required.)
